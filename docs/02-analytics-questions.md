Operations (Efficiency & Fulfillment)

1. Which specific restaurants have the highest 'Driver Wait Time'?"
 (Are drivers standing around for 20 minutes while food is prepped, killing our network efficiency?)

2. "What percentage of orders are delivered late (>45 mins) broken down by neighborhood?" (Is East Legon slower than Osu due to traffic or bad dispatching?)

3. "Which drivers are consistently 'ghosting' assigned orders?" (Identifying drivers who accept an order but never move towards the pickup location).

4. "What is the cancellation rate after food is prepared?" (This is pure waste—who pays for the wasted food, us or the vendor?)

Finance (Profitability & Reconciliation)

5. "What is our true Net Revenue per order after subtracting driver payouts and refunds?" (Are we actually making money on small orders, or are the margins negative?)

6. "Which orders have a discrepancy between the 'App Price' and the 'Payment Gateway Settlement'?" (Did the user pay GHS 50 but the bank only settled GHS 45? Where is the leak?)

7. "What is the total value of unrecovered refunds?" (When we refund a customer for "missing items," did we successfully claw that money back from the restaurant, or did we eat the cost?)

8. "How much are we spending on 'Driver Surge' bonuses vs. the extra fees we collected from customers?" (Are our subsidies sustainable?)

Management (Growth & Retention)

9. "What is the Month-1 Retention Rate for new customers acquired via Instagram ads?" (Do they order once and leave, or do they become regulars?)

10. "Which 'Cuisine Types' are trending down in order volume over the last 3 months?" (Should we stop onboarding more Pizza places and look for Local Food vendors instead?)

11. "What is the 'Time to First Order' for new users?" (How many people download the app, register, but never place a single order?)

12. "Who are our top 1% of customers by Lifetime Value (LTV), and what is their most common drop-off location?" (So we can target them with loyalty perks).
