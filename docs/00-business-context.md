Type of Business: This is an on-demand delivery platform (similar to UberEats or Bolt Food) that connects three distinct parties: customers placing orders, local restaurants/vendors preparing them, and independent courier drivers delivering them.

Revenue Model: The company generates revenue through a commission fee charged to the restaurant for every order and a separate delivery fee (plus occasional "small order" surcharges) paid by the customer.

Day-to-Day Operations: Operations involve a continuous stream of real-time events: users browsing the app, the dispatch algorithm matching orders to the nearest available drivers, and GPS tracking of the delivery route from pickup to drop-off.

Stakeholders: Operations teams urgently need data on delivery times and driver availability; Finance needs accurate reconciliation of payouts and refund costs; and Product Managers track app crashes and checkout conversion rates.

Current Blind Spots: Decisions on dynamic pricing (how much to hike fees during rain or traffic) are currently based on gut feeling rather than data, and the company has no visibility into why drivers are churning (quitting) after their first month.
